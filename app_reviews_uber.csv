0,It used to be a great app i used it for everything but since drivers are just wasting your time by canceling the trips sometimes even at the point of pick up and its not just once but sometimes it happens to the point of not having any drivers available The reason: they dont accept debit/credit cards anymore just cash And it is for every trip i request Totally disapointed I wont use it again :(,0.007813308914790444,0.35668494679904755,0.5112405870326964,0.12426115725346563
1,Painful experience First the app halts after every map movement when selecting location Second everytime it connects to a driver driver accepts the ride and the first message of the driver is Where do you want to go and then the driver decides whether to continue the ride or not Sometimes we have to wait and talk to 34 drivers and waste 3040 minutes before finally using the ride This is not acceptable in any way Why every driver wants 510 minutes ride Maybe your incentives,0.0068103296126458355,0.006738974481104715,0.4934440482296164,0.49300664767663294
2,I would say horrible customer service but that would mean they have customer service I waited outside for over an hour trying to reactivate my account after being told since youre in an unsafe location but currently safe I will report your concerns and the team will be with you shortly After 40mins I called again and was told the same thing What is the purpose of having a safety or emergency line when they dont help you in a safety or emergency situation,0.755496545119147,0.05073531522188396,0.007054872088072566,0.18671326757089662
3,Not sure what happened since COVID  probably 2 yrs since my last trip  but it seems in the effort to streamline the app has become confusing: to set pickup points determine where the vehicles are (ie: what the wait time is) and even the vehicle tiers have changed I get that there are users that learn the ins and outs every time there is an app update but if you want to attract more casual users stop changing the interface After 10 minutes of mucking about I just grabbed a cab,0.0068977762355450474,0.504480804948935,0.4815266708844213,0.007094747931098714
4,Usally an ok app but twice Ive had trouble with rides and have received little help Today a driver drove to the drop off address instead of picking me up and when I called her all she said to do was cancel it Contacted customer service and they refuse to give me my money back even though I was never in the car Most of the time its 5 stars but the customer service is a 1 if I could give it 0 stars I would ,0.6704022731414289,0.008573962166502466,0.31222512000022223,0.008798644691846413
5,Card transactions are being declined when theres funds available Next thing you have an amount owing but on your bank statement the transaction is successful Some drivers just cancel a trip after waiting for over 5 minutes and you have to request again Then wait again for another driver yet they are quick to cancel when they are the ones waiting,0.20475521958657783,0.22498616163282623,0.5602104370249069,0.010048181755689098
6,The trip fee changes once we end the trip We agreed to a trip because the fee is affordable but here the fee increases once the trip is ended Please fix this i trusted uber until now but this issue keep me doubting of the transparency of your service This happened not only to me and fyi i never changed the destination never asked to wait for anything nor did anything which cause to increase the fee The driver was bad at navigation maybe that was the reason But thats not my problem,0.007555369728724075,0.23150228136004716,0.38388008250582983,0.37706226640539886
7,I have been using the app in the UK for years but what happened today was absolutely outrageous After not finding a driver for like 34 mins a ~ £28 ride jumped up to ~£65 I have never seen anything like this and obviously as I had to get to the train station with my family I had accept that scandalous price Shame on you Uber This is an absolutely disgusting move and I am deeply disappointed Rest assured I wont use the service in my life ever again,0.15203330465844705,0.6983628701285555,0.14255756271259046,0.0070462625004069305
8,It was a good app before But just today I was so disappointed I was charged more than what I expected When I reported it the reply was it was based on the estimated time Even the driver was shocked of the fare It was supposedly 8 QR but was turned out to be 2134 I usually pay 8qr from Oqba IBN Nafie metro station to Jaber Bin Aflah,0.3830584349210369,0.010695159119181613,0.5950683315285179,0.011178074431263542
9,Overall experience is pretty satisfactory You get what youre supposed to But the Uber Moto service is abysmal so much so that you have to answer to the Moto Drivers about where youre headed and then youre left at their mercy on whether youre going to get the ride or not It is practically impossible to book a successful ride using Uber moto Its a shame that Uber has not taken any steps to address this issue,0.3362519930271668,0.007475246774892258,0.4457080263091767,0.21056473388876432
10,The problem with this app facility is that the drivers keeps on cancelling the rides They will call the customer and once they get to know that the location also if you dont recieve their call they will cancel the rides that too after 1520 mins Whereas if the customer cancels the rides after waiting for 40mins or so they will be charged for cancelling the ride Weird,0.010008627931546792,0.010034103500778137,0.39332190516209276,0.5866353634055823
11,There is something wrong with the way 2FA mobile number is displayed during 2FA setup process ie after + begins immediately the number with no country code As much as confusing (and worrying at the point of setup making you think you may lock yourself out) seems to be working fine and delivering messages I was also experiencing multiple text messages about the same thing (redundant) In some cases even 10 messages informing above the very same thing within the space of couple of seconds,0.2483525858013829,0.7365000383337639,0.007379698301739696,0.007767677563113676
12,The app is okay overall The greatest drawback for me is when a driver is almost 20 minutes away By the time the car arrives Im already too late for my classes I would really appreciate it if uber would find me the rides closest to me and that drivers themselves not accept rides if they are that far away to save us both time,0.009540937649979995,0.009578950434327528,0.9713418977490137,0.009538214166678728
13,Yesterday I booked an auto in the app Once I got the auto booked the time shown was 2 minutes More than 10 minutes gone he didnt come alost 15 minutes I called him he asks me where is the destination I told him my address which is just a little more than 1km from star market He said hell come in a minute and then he cancels the trip Whats bad Uber asking me to pay Rs20/ cancellation feeWhy am I supposed to pay for their drivers unprofessional conduct This happened before also,0.09337151667776315,0.005715771998117376,0.3287608981716476,0.572151813152472
14,You let drivers to cancel the trip if the payment is too low at the selected hour and they send report that people dont wear mask I had this issue this morning on another account he was on the way to the meeting point and he canceled so now I have a mail in which Ive been reported for not wearing a mask but he didnt even showed and he canceled because he foolishly accepted at a lower price (29Ron) and now I cant even make a report on your app because there is no trip on my app,0.25073726938211477,0.23878127399873056,0.5034083343799205,0.007073122239234219
15,They give unrealistic waiting time And after you wait whole time which is generally 1520 minutes cab driver call u to ask for destination If drop  off location is not suitable to them  they cancel it in few seconds and this keeps on repeating  After so many such experience uninstalling this app And you cant even rate the driver who have wasted your time,0.009427713928010114,0.009622234930874163,0.525098282274682,0.4558517688664337
16,This app is horrible It doesnt let you get or send your referral code so you cant refer anyone I called and got my referral code and my friend signed up and completed the requirements and she didnt get the guaranteed amount and I didnt get the referral reward The referral promo is a scam They get you to do rides and dont pay you Customer service is horrible They farm the calls our to foreign countries who cant understand or speak English therefore you get no help Imdone with uber,0.9801034945293767,0.006816206793700532,0.006487830516004181,0.006592468160918388
17,Does not deserve even one star Autos are never available when needed I would suggest the developers to revisit why they came up with the app in the first place  because if convinence was one of the reason they have definitely failed to achive it Have to wait 30 mins for one rickshaw to accept a ride And on the top of it charges are extravagant Unfortunately have no other choice to keep using the app even though it does not fulfil its purpose,0.10759874196717459,0.18631060699580293,0.3727725066174017,0.33331814441962077
18,Uber transportation is Great However their Application can stand a WHOLE LOT OF IMPROVEMENT Very hard to navigate too time consuming Most of the time you cannot find the actual answers to your specific questions or concerns The little boxes that you type in are very hard to find It wont except emails and there are No phone numbers to call The Drivers can call but not the patrons or (passengers) Very poor application JM,0.33785435863664753,0.21910036576742078,0.16900639064155495,0.27403888495437667
19,Uber generallly is great but the pickup spot gps can be trash sometimes The address will be correct but the pickup spot will be 8 minutes away and the driver will go to the pick up spot not the from address This the very troublesome if u dont know the area well I shouldnt have to fix the map just to get picked up at the right address if my from address is correct Then the driver cancells the ride cause he has to travel to fr to pick me up when the pick up spot took him elsewhere,0.9796476225903811,0.006611158937586253,0.007089802299193907,0.0066514161728387
20,I took a trip that said the price would range from $16  $21 because it was a booked trip It charged me 29 dollars  tried to fix the issue they took of the wait time or 38c and i tried to change it because thats not what i wanted They refused to change the price after charging me an extra $14 Even though the price was not suppose to go above 21 dollars no counting wait time I spend over $115 weekly Never again Just lost a customer Update: 2021 checked for improvements Just get Lyft,0.31346571024197667,0.6110527574279255,0.06962313979031484,0.005858392539783049
21,Dear Uber Kindly remove the term affordable from your tagline Most of the times your rides are not affordable even when the demand for rides is low I dont wish to hear any silly explanations regarding your pricing model  I have heard it all If you want to be honest then best do away with your affordability claims,0.009372247314453502,0.42845084926081206,0.21611728442905512,0.3460596189956794
22,Terrible service from the support team Took n hour to take care of something that o ly takes two minutes to take care of You dont even deserve a 1 star I have been for six years an gold member and five star rider Accounts have been merged several times and the account have been merged in two different occasions i was previously told before tht it wouldnt happen again and it did Took an hour to attend something that only takes two minutes I missed a job interview because of this ,0.41012062152417383,0.11717969410762515,0.28359512423945676,0.18910456012874435
23,The application is working well The 1 star is for the process which allowes drivers to cancel a trip for no reason For the past 3 months it became a habit for the drivers to cancel trips Today Ive placed an order which was canceled by 3 drivers all of them close to the location (36 min) Very poor service,0.010429863602079785,0.009905940770579876,0.9697107455339617,0.009953450093378606
24,In the area where I live there are plenty of ehailing servicesbut I decided to try Uber as their prices seemed more reasonableunfortunately from the time I have downloaded the app til today I have been unsuccessful in obtaining an Uber rideover 10mins and its still trying to connect to a driveryet they are aroundvery disappointed,0.42820052040502193,0.5466614485446961,0.012781116881665987,0.01235691416861608
25,I scheduled a ride (four hours ahead of time) to hospital the ride was confirmed At the pickup time I received a notification that no drivers were available I had to make alternate arrangements which has cost me dearly in order to make my appointment You have no facility on the app to address this issue Your service is seriously lacking,0.6833394981294207,0.00980957265593817,0.16851055028602935,0.13834037892861167
26,Every time I want to book an auto it would take minimum of 10 mins to book it And if I get confirmation once that my booking is done and driver is on the way the ride gets cancelled without even me cancelling it I am annoyed with this I dont want to give that 1 rating also but zeri rating is not possible If zero is available I would have given that,0.010153092741280234,0.009941398649723506,0.28270662772208066,0.6971988808869155
27,The app used to be good I like the live map Ive had good experiences with journeys if I manage to get a driver I always get bounced around by the app now  connected then disconnected waiting This predates the fuel shortage I have a high rating as well so its not that A friend told me its because it bumps up surge pricing I took a normal taxi yesterday one way then an uber  difference in fare was £8 vs £15 Uber cost me double for the same journey Overall not impressed,0.006133726003049875,0.573828764314198,0.4139705297512139,0.006066979931538352

29,There should something for drivers arrogant behavior before the pickup  To be real honest  if they dont want to come or go to a certain destination then they should cancel it at the very right moment but they dont so they keep us on waiting  hoping that we will cancel and take fine charges upon us This is ridiculous  It disappoints a lotWaste of timemoney Please do look into this  I have been using uber for a long time Else there are plenty of other applications as well  Thanks,0.008441737957469164,0.008480784492227238,0.6991169220052358,0.2839605555450677

31,This app was the best some months back but nowadays its hardly any helpful I used to recommend this to everyone but not anymore The drivers arent good anymore infact they are more demanding than ever If only Uber introduces some rules that restrict drivers to cancel the ride based on their mood or requirements Its very annoying when the drivers call just to ask the drop location and cancel the ride And this has happened not once not twice but a dozen times Its pathetic,0.006888816179755003,0.007219161568842447,0.35128892679947865,0.634603095451924
32,Be careful about surge charges My very first trip went from $39 to $106 They only show you the regular fares in the list so you select it because its the cheapest in the list But if you wait one minute more and select the next level car you can save two thirds of the cost They get newbies with this all the time Im sure so be carefule of the gotcha in this app Look for the little man with the x3 and dont select that one in the list,0.5234412191196594,0.2868132405919141,0.18149704073080283,0.008248499557623799
33,This app used to have an option to chat/describe your situation when reporting Now it only provides few set options to describe the situation There are unnecessary charges to my card for the negligence of a driver cancelling on me And even after they say the amt is refunded the app shows 0 charged but a month later and Im still waiting for 3 refunds Also very often the driver starts his trip towards me and cancels Moving back to regular taxi service since Uber has become very unreliable,0.2302672670206825,0.2322778829649471,0.21511211759967405,0.32234273241469635
34,the app experience with uber eats was so bad  i ordered dinner but never received it while the delivery person claimed the order was finished tried to reach uber support from app live chat or phone (all failed) had to file for refund but was still charged the tips wish the app can be improved with more interactions eg user confirming if order is received and user can live chat or file for complaints directly would not use it again until it is improved,0.9813966285405752,0.006241289273157518,0.00610989582986847,0.006252186356398829
35,What a fall from grace Drives always cancel cant follow a simple map and then I always get charged extra The app bounces me from 10 different drivers before telling me UberX isnt available and the doubles the price and instantly finds me a trip Absolutely horrendous just save yourself the time and energy and learn to drive,0.008247854089897972,0.00863330095546193,0.9747502622548474,0.008368582699792812
36,This use to be a good app Easy and quick to use In recent times this has become an issue Connecting to multiple drivers who cancel immediately meaning wait times are increasing and the overall cost seems to go up Frequently you can be waiting over 1015 minutes for it to just connect to a driver The increased fees make this app unusual moving forward,0.008109388529528423,0.007741231905255609,0.9764931351119224,0.0076562444532935585
37,Good when it works Heres the problem I have Its not the drivers Its the apps behavior It takes your money before you even get a ride then your stuck waiting for a ride for hours knowing your money has been taken already Lyft does not do this They wait until pick up and drop off to extract there fee Please get rid of this bc sometimes you cant even find a ride and then you still take my money,0.5199127621651717,0.009370933427197109,0.3522337947408081,0.118482509666823
38,But something happened today My driver was changed three times before I eventually started my ride I have never had this experience before If its a system error it should be fixed please The two drivers that started the trip never cancelled my trip It was same request but vehicle an driver kept changing The driver that eventually gave me the rider is not same driver that started the trip So I dont know how possible it is for different drivers to keep interrupting the trip Its scary,0.2647407760406779,0.007317793378238879,0.007449648264161666,0.7204917823169216
39,When I press on a pinned location sent through WhatsApp the app doesnt show anything regarding available cars or trip routes But when I manually enter a wellknown location like a mall or park it works just fine Why is that Other than the app not working when I press on a specific pinned location it works just fine,0.9736183681434027,0.008646328427785132,0.009097856118508317,0.00863744731030373
40,Worst app ever this app and the drivers should stop working if they can not do their duty properly The drivers deny to pick up their customers because of their so called excuses such  location is far etc etc  their excuses are always ready Im a student and most booking are done form home to college Which is not as far as they complaint And if they can not cover a short distance like this I think its useless to run this app (Different drivers denied 4times in a row),0.25240577058697844,0.006530705339890776,0.2457656316261551,0.49529789244697553
41,What a pathetic service If hailing cabs was difficult before it has become a nightmare with Uber At least 5 drivers will cancel before one even accepts the trip Ive had drivers refuse to accept online payments and just waiting outside my pickup point without cancelling so that I get charged with a cancellation fee So yeah it cannot get worse than this,0.009162104869227207,0.13228965585360483,0.562906770960264,0.29564146831690397
42,No option to contact support you can only get canned responses based on selecting from a list of suggested issues Trying to get in touch with someone for any kind of assistance regarding the app and its bugs and glitches is almost impossible For example when I try to change my profile picture Im told I need to contact Uber for assistance but there is no option,0.874835172628825,0.10916731281266272,0.007939651027447009,0.008057863531065199
43,Now this service is going pathetic It shows the driver is coming Neither the cab comes nor he cancels the ride So the cancellation charges are bear by me Plus after waiting for more than 30 mins I usually miss my appointments Even after complaining on the app itselfno response from the company itself Too bad,0.009995426724660958,0.009955860462278516,0.4483677611007971,0.5316809517122634
44,For last 3 4 times I ordered an uber auto the amount they show at the booking time always changes when i reach the destination every time there is an increase of 10 to 20 bucks and there is no valid reason for it The drivers dont make a call when they arrive it has been twice that both of us were at the pick up point but the driver stopped at a distance and I was unable to figure out whether it is my ordered auto or not and hence waiting charges were added ,0.11967955395272006,0.24414622412178894,0.2636116021880498,0.37256261973744126
45,I never had any issue with Uber but the last time recently I used Uber I am so much disappointed No customer care number provided by Uber In case we need to talk to a customer support executive They are only using mail functionality which is also so slow and useless in my regard Got extra charged for a trip still no status of them refunding my amount Very dissatisfied and wont ever use Uber again,0.7631524741089505,0.007682658963752711,0.007448700134144456,0.22171616679315231
46,Imagine making an app that doesnt recognize the phone number of the device its downloaded onto I uninstalled the app for 3 years and redownloaded it because thats enough time to fix something like that I had low expectations but you guys somehow missed the mark for something that simple,0.011975162587458186,0.9660399277494918,0.011164765315452999,0.010820144347596952
47,This app is a waste of time The auto drivers are so rude They accept the ride and then call and tell that they cant come They ask us to cancel the ride instead of doing that themselves I have been denied 7times in four days Even after writing the full and particular address the auto drivers say that they thought it was some other place on top of that they argue with the customers I personally dont recommend this app,0.009124399826021146,0.008158609104996748,0.00837764577825751,0.9743393452907245
48,Been using this app for atleast 5 years Drivers first make you wait while completing another drop After a good wait of 710 mins they finish their previous ride and ask for location only to cancel your ride wasting 1015 mins of your life If the driver does not come to your location and youre forced to cancel you lose out on a penalty fee Absolute waste of money and time unless they fix this,0.006411157690285251,0.0065156943831977355,0.7020308411324737,0.2850423067940432
49,It was always a good app until I find myself some drivers are kinda scamming here in uber by taking extra charges this has happened not only once but thrice I payed 800 900 while my normal fare which was shown during booking was just 465 500  I tried 3 4 different no Of their customer service but not working at all  thought of calling police at last but just for 400500 I dont want to create a bigger problem  Im telling you guys better download Ola its more safer ,0.006606513835549549,0.3216932927851732,0.16421516373748044,0.5074850296417968
50,Whatever updates you have made to the app are not working Reliability has gone for a complete toss Earlier one could rely on the initial wait time Now the app shows a wait time and time to destination (which one uses to plan their trip) which doubles as you soon as confirm booking is clicked Also the time it takes to find a taxi is painfully long Hope you fix this  the least go back to what the app was before  much much reliable than what it is now,0.007515232260612597,0.4887017176260984,0.35422679848699046,0.1495562516262985
51,Terrible the prices are too expensive They are always price gouging during busy hours I also really dislike that drivers can cancel the request When Im in a hurry to get to work it takes FOREVER to get a driver This app isnt reliable anymore The app was better before all these updates,0.07317781391062095,0.3999095787590101,0.5166663760977711,0.010246231232597866
52,BEWARE THE DRIVERS WILL CHANGE ON YOU My driver was changed 3 times and I spent 45 minutes waiting for drivers that never came while needing to go to the airport on time There wasnt even a notification that it was changed or cancelled I just kept the app open I eventually cancelled and took a taxi My first Uber ride was a horrible experience that didnt even end up happening,0.5767917966277772,0.007661808599891659,0.4078634314551223,0.007682963317208931

54,Generally good but it depends on how many drivers are available in your area and if theyre decent I was going to work once and the driver spent 15 minutes getting gas ugh The app just showed the car stopped Almost ended up late Also for some reason setting up a ride in advance is WAY more expensive A short ride that costs me $812 normally is over $30 if I schedule it in advance so I dont do that But overall Ive had more good rides than not,0.006394422718254983,0.38111430074629327,0.6064774402514385,0.006013836284013312

56,It had a great service in start but now they are just fraud Dont use this application at all it shows you 384 fare charge you 996 later and upon complaining they say you were charged fairly Their drivers took my parcel away which I sent through uberconnect upon complaining they didnt even give me a good response and never took a action against driver,0.3825394749629356,0.008882318427621555,0.009193339648610325,0.5993848669608325
57,Since theres no way to complain about this in the app its being reflected in this review instead There are drivers which will wait barely 30 seconds outside your house before driving off and making you wait 15 minutes for another car and theres nothing you can do about it Cant put a complaint in or anything Just had a guy drive off without even messaging to say hes here now having to wait 17 minutes more Its a waste of my time,0.1522501366167045,0.007407816365430784,0.8328017961406956,0.0075402508771691395
58,It used to be a good app but now its sucks it results in me not being on time other times I wait on the driver and when theres only 5 mins left they cancel on me and I have to start the process all over again its infuriating please fix this and find a solution I hate that I have to wait for these drivers for 30 mins and they cancel on me on half of the time limit I went through 3 to 4 drivers in that time I dont like to be punished for it,0.00820669428642972,0.008016121467485525,0.9761353158169322,0.007641868429152585
59,I had set up a pick up time with advanced notice to the airport Ive never had a problem until now I waiting for my ride bit it never arrived Uber canceled on me 20 min after my puck uptime past And it was to much of late notice to get a lift Why would you have a time schedule for pick up but not honor those times This will be the last time I use uber very disappointed in the lack of people and them not wanting to work,0.3311726974948846,0.007600073919842651,0.6538674927646748,0.0073597358205980574
60,The app is messed up at best I cannot access my previous rides to tip them and the tipping is also messed up to the point it doesnt show your tip sometimes I have double tipped drivers because of this and eaten the cost but now I cant even check and tip retroactively I work in the service industry and understand how important tips are but this is beyond abusing the customer for company and employee profit Theres also no way to contact the company about this which is infuriating,0.25754072332137407,0.6777594036493181,0.05700943449674832,0.007690438532559593
61,I ordered on food on this app because it allows you to have everything in one app It charged me 3 times for a single order I thought it was just reserving the money like it does sometimes But I checked my banking app and balance which showed that it deducted it THREE TIMES FOR ONE ORDER Ive gone through all possible channels to get a refund / sort out the issue but no response or accountability has been taken Thoroughly disappointed in Uber as I expected more  better from them,0.9789223275600288,0.007080383597158523,0.006923869580782053,0.0070734192620303775
62,Regardless the initial booking the driver first confirm the heading location and payment type via call or message If they arent interested then automatically canceled by rider which too much pathetic call and even they say to cancel the ride Its being since a long befor around 1 year Which should be must concern upon this and update the policy which will be convenient for customer,0.00974815180561929,0.11572307053677593,0.00987151144780844,0.8646572662097963
63,Whenever we book a location your drivers call and ask for the location and if isnt suitable theyll cancel it If you charge us on cancellation for the efforts drive made to reach us we also wait and rely on them so give us amount as well And basically its not about money sometimes we stand at railway station or bus station late at night or early in the morning and then thats it Theyll call and cancel and keep on cancelling in a row I remember once 10 cabs cancelled Not good,0.007066269777325667,0.06840727670722667,0.6006045245970784,0.32392192891836946
64,Thier app fed up and took me to a place far away from where I needed to be which I didnt recognize on the way there due to me only being there once for a job I had to redo the trip and ended up paying double what the trip cost I disputed the charge with uber but they were slow on the uptake of admitting fault so I disputed with my bank and they returned me the amount I disputed (50%) Now uber has frozen my account demanding I pay them the whole amount for something THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT,0.44958948054812126,0.35738100817379514,0.007586128690602485,0.18544338258748103
65,No way to report an app issue only driver issues My problem is with the app it will not allow selecting the proper pickup spot (Lynchburg VA airport) Tried to put in the pickup spot for private flights and it redirects to the commercial terminal Only option is to direct the driver a few hundred yards from the proper pickup spot then message the driver In my case driver handled it well but would have been better if the app allowed selecting the proper location,0.9259025530014373,0.0063148622449908775,0.06140867599033937,0.006373908763232422
66,Hands down one of the worst verification methodologies deployed by any app for identifying returning customers after period of inactivity Nobody can remember their ride/driver/car details in the manner being asked for verification nor is the subsequent redressal methodology suggested of any use I have reset my account and in process lost my data stored against all the rides taken,0.009048617188169931,0.6365446904739569,0.00893523646225778,0.3454714558756153
67,Very poor service and quality of drivers post Lockdown We have to wait almost 45 min to book a ride as everyone were asking where you want to go and how you will pay I know its just a review for Uber and none is going to pay attention  but I can predict that this uber in India will become bankrupt within 23 years after this kind of reviews of drivers,0.008366892574027675,0.008545013555134678,0.5539222867097805,0.4291658071610572
68,Uber is usually decent until you hit the price change time 1890 for a ride that was confirmed Ride got cancelled when the driver was 4 miles away from me and was replaced by someone 24 mins out I cancelled Tried to book another ride Price jumped from 1890 to 31 So my confirmed ride got cancelled because the price of the ride itself went up 12 bucks F Uber,0.4553006905336408,0.3131883766485601,0.22387718098609574,0.007633751831703425
69,Ive been satisfied with the service so far until today I am highly allergic to dogs and cats unfortunately and could sense instantly upon getting in the vehicle that animals had been inside on a regular or at least just previously (dog saliva to be exact) I would suggest that if a owner decides to uber at least let riders know so allergy suffers like myself have the choice to ride or not,0.5232579717787557,0.008511067747861506,0.2285601020124396,0.23967085846094316
70,I have the UberEats version of this for food delivery Not only is the app very glitch and unreliable to the point that my orders dont show up a lot of time but the costumer service is appalling At times when my delivery has been wrong or not completed there is no option to leave feedback and the app does not allow for costumer friendly usage to resolve the issue quickly Instead they are very happy to just take money for undelivered orders and make it especially difficult to reach support,0.8760305590775255,0.006304006695833354,0.11139022893302913,0.00627520529361206

72,Worst service No control over trips Drivers accept the trip and keep you waiting for long time so you will cancel Not one time but Every time I try uber same case If company does not know how to control the drivers please exit business instead of making passengers struggle I know understand why Ola is way better than Uber There is no way to complain when waiting for Driver to arrive pickup location I rate 0 for Customer experience,0.006073604076751247,0.005915962311813356,0.5473471435511201,0.4406632900603153
73,This app is good but sometimes the drivers are so annoying especially the auto drivers Few days ago I confirmed an auto ride The driver asked me my where to go location he simply asked me to cancel my ride instead of transferring it himself When I asked him to do it so that I wont get any additional charges for cancelling the ride he simple ignored my message and didnt cancel so I had to do it This happened twice with me I also have the screenshot of the conversation,0.0073582049436729646,0.09542596021395937,0.1677386096881493,0.7294772251542182
74,Used to be a great service Lately it takes a really long time to get a ride because every driver cancels the request Use the service if you are willing to spend 10 to 30 minutes waiting for a driver that accepts the trip If you are in a hurry use any of other ride sharing apps,0.008979695226870527,0.009127699427586957,0.9728093105035323,0.009083294842010382
75,New update broke the UI Been using the app for a few months now as my local taxi service sucks normally OK except the surge fare being 3x4x normal fare regularly But the latest update broke the user interface I cant schedule a ride cant cancel a ride cant see my driver all I can do is zoom in and out in Google maps,0.008387630833987176,0.873994735228776,0.008383316369832186,0.10923431756740457
76,To be frank Uber is good actually but when the payment method in Google play gets error and doesnt pay with that the driver might ask to pay through his gpay scanner and you might pay off thinking that the ride payment is over But no it still gets carried on the next ride For eg: if I had to pay 400₹ for a ride in which scenario I might scan and pay him instead of the app the next time when you ride it shows that you still have 400₹ to be paid yet The driver must update Uber as paid,0.28704546190619745,0.006781011985056611,0.006480487426704725,0.6996930386820411
77,I dont know what is going on but in Paris alone the amount of time to get an Uber ride has on average tripled since I was last here and the prices have rocketed The ease of this app used to make it a pleasurable alternative to public transportation but now I struggle to justify the combination of the wait and price If this was 2 or 3 years ago I would have given it 5 stars but Ill settle for 2 stars today,0.29431424021123176,0.4601325053631072,0.23702944192336964,0.008523812502291417

79,It used to be a good app but now its completely useless Drivers first accept the ride then they ask location n cancel We are connected to multiple driver but they all cancel Some drivers are so rude that they talk rudely n ask me to cancel the ride just because they find the drop location is far according to them Pathetic n useless app,0.008466422372986648,0.008424445502253226,0.32648678203128956,0.6566223500934705

81,The app for the most part is sound However having drivers accept a job then 510 minutes in cancel is unfair This happens a little more than it should and when its 3am and Ive finished work its just pain uncool The is especially true when if a user cancels they get charged a fee Please do review this,0.010036104563147128,0.5110817427190493,0.46887591324990635,0.010006239467897162
82,There needs to be a feature to rate a driver when you cancel the drive I have waited 30 min for a driver to drive down a street who didnt answer my 20 calls and I ended up missing my bus to another city for which I already had tickets The sheer incompetency of some drivers is astonishing and I am sure most of them keep the great ratings because you cant leave a bad review for them not even coming to you,0.00813644522671864,0.007847662819281401,0.976035957967997,0.007979933986002956

85,As far as customer service goes their terrible with refunding anything with some dumb policy linked to a allocated number of refunds allowed regardless if its the restaurant or the drivers fault For instance food was missing from delivered order and there response was to please write what could be done to help the merchant fix this problem Im like and  What about the damn money you took for the full order thats what it comes down to for everyone  I know doordash is way better 4food,0.9199569871917624,0.006479190997950359,0.06709454162343632,0.006469280186850912

87,This used to be a good app But nowadays driver behaviour is very rude Most of them chareg ove rand above the app fare and if we dont agree force us to cancel the ride There is no way to complain makes the situation worse Who wants to waste precious time in arguing and bargaining Its no better than hiring offline taxi services if this is the situation After a couple of persistent issues I have stopped relying on Uber Very very bad,0.08140280000858359,0.006915766627713482,0.37719998695452595,0.534481446409177
88,As a visitor in Pakistan the service and procedure has drastically gone down When you book now the driver accepts and asks a stupid question (kahan jana hai) and then they reject it Secondly a fare is booked based on satellite route and by the time the destination is reached the fare is doubled How is this possible I can understand a few rupees higher but not 100% Ridiculous Certainly not a talk of town like it used to be few years ago Good Luck UBER,0.006324651518131402,0.13545725507503115,0.2439418402599564,0.6142762531468812
89,It works well when there are cabs available However there is a lack of cabs in some areas Also quite a few times many drivers accept the trip but move in another direction if they dont want to take it leaving no option but to cancel which is charged to us There should be an option to change the driver in this case and to report the previous driver,0.0104628141821215,0.010433458360412453,0.7908968171231573,0.1882069103343087
90,Drivers keep cancelling Fine if they dont want to drive me for whatever reason but when youre pickup time is 20 minutes out and your driver cancels after 10 minutes of waiting youre going to be late to whatever your were trying to get too Uber is not worth it anymore As a passenger you pay a fee to the driver when you cancel for the inconvenience but as a passenger you just get screwed,0.007668916246468436,0.007742961758561885,0.9767908308146291,0.00779729118034052

1229,This is the worst thing to experience I have booked an uber auto firstly it shows Rs60 for the trip and during the journey it shows the longest route while the shorter route passes by and when I reach at my destination the fare was Rs90 seriously increased by Rs30 who does this if you are showing a particular amount then how could you change it whenever you want It is fraud with the users they are cheating by showing low price and then increase it during trip so that one has to pay,0.006715156580528774,0.16576280260317178,0.006909129147822974,0.8206129116684766

5776,I am disappointed that Uber waits until the end of the pickup period to let you know that there are no rides available That caused me to almost miss my flight and incur additional expenses for parking my car at the airport Reliability of transportation is essential in todays world and Uber apparently doesnt think this is a priority Its okay if rides are not available but Uber should strive to notify the user ASAP to make other travel arrangements Ill be trying other ridesgare services,0.8529651108325562,0.006132402208586229,0.13477540076108172,0.0061270861977757735

5778,Uber made a false statement and intimation to me about not wearing the mask during a trip when in fact I was wearing it during the entire trip properly The truth is that the driver was staring at me in a weird way during the whole trip which made me feel really uncomfortable I always respected all the rules about covid and I take all the measurements seriously After that the uber took it out all my trip discounts and now all my trips have a very expensive price DONT RECOMMEND,0.18761360485376902,0.07405827570983299,0.730435287239307,0.007892832197091219

5787,Ive been using Uber for approximately 4 years now and generally Ive had no problems with it But to wait 20 minutes in the rain for no drivers to show up despite having scheduled a ride 3 hours in advance is irritating And to then cancel the scheduled ride and order a new one only to be charged 3 times the original cost of the ride and still have to wait another 10 minutes in the rain is infuriating,0.10112665918759847,0.11484456325584866,0.7768429747034786,0.007185802853074305

5790,Uber has been my main way of getting to and from work for years but it has become wildly unreasonable in price and rider experience for awhile now The app tries to trick you into paying 2 or 3 times the usual rate of your ride when you first open the app My usual ride was normally just under $20 but Ive seen the rates go up to $60 to $80 on a weekly (if not daily) basis for the same 16 mile ride Plus drivers cancel all the time I have had my ride canceled for the 3rd time today alone,0.005451557988816151,0.7353045722772674,0.13541763827729034,0.12382623145662608
5791,I like uber but I really think there should be set prices The prices are always different If I wanted a ride that was 8 minutes away sometimes its $8 sometimes its $10 and at one point it was $40 I understand you might price rides low or high depending on how busy it is but its rediculous that I need to check the app every two minutes to see if the price went down Please do something about this,0.008688930908754538,0.6987822890437692,0.2839165906109186,0.008612189436557768

5810,The app does what its supposed to The annoying thing about it is that I can only specify the correct pickup location at my home by dropping a pin on the map which gives the driver an incorrect address or I can specify my address at the expense of the ability to specify the correct pickup location So the driver either ends up waiting for me at the wrong address or gets lost in inside my community because the map data used by the app is imprecise This is super annoying Please fix,0.9808162135291432,0.006318797041149393,0.006611569437837036,0.0062534199918705055

5945,I think the drivers have too much power and control over prices especially when an individual selects the Uber Go option Drivers lately have been either ignoring the request so that they can drive up the prices by demand or they accept the request and decide not to show up at all or deliberately take a longer route so that they charge more I find that unprofessional and unacceptable,0.00962439188542588,0.18677911337106393,0.7937149170689094,0.009881577674600777

6048,Worst app in my opinion The estimated time of arrival is so wrong ubers dont accept rides if they see that you are paying with card and you have to sit there and wait for someone to finally pick your ride Once an uber cancelled me for not having a mask when he didnt even saw me and no where to complain about such thing If I cancel them I have to pay a fee and if they cancell they dont get punish enough I honestly hate so much this app,0.0074533399951690026,0.06701779409759372,0.9178287566577981,0.007700109249439174
